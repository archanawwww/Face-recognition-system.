# Face-recognition-system.
A face recognition system in Python that captures 50 photos of a person and detects facial features (eyes, mouth) using OpenCV and pre-trained cascade classifiers.
This project implements a face recognition system that captures photos of a person and uses OpenCV and Python libraries to detect and recognize faces by analyzing facial features such as eyes and mouth. The system utilizes:

OpenCV for capturing video frames, drawing shapes, and processing images.
Face Recognition for encoding and comparing faces to identify individuals.
Cascade Classifiers for detecting specific facial features like eyes and mouth using pre-trained models.
The system captures and stores images, then processes them to enable accurate facial recognition in real-time.
